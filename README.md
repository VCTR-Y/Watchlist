# My Personal Project

## Watch List

The project I would like to make for this term is a watchlist.
You can add a show or movie to your watchlist and mark it as
**To Watch**, **Watching**, or **Watched**. In your watchlist, you'll
be able to keep track of all the shows and movies you've watched, want to watch,
or are currently watching. You'll also be able to give a rating and write a comment for **Watched**
shows and movies.

This program will be useful for those who watch shows and movies.
As an individual who does this, I often find myself losing track of
what I'm watching, especially after an extended period of time. Therefore,
I'm sure there are many other people who have a similar problem too.
